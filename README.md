### Exploring CPI Components and Forecasting Inflation Trends    

CPI (Consumer Price Index) or Indeks Harga Konsumen is an economic indicator that provides information about the prices of goods and services paid by consumers. The CPI calculation is conducted to record changes in consumer purchase prices for a fixed basket of goods and services that are commonly consumed by the public.  

🪄The models used in this analysis include **Ridge/Lasso Regression** and time series forecasting methods with **Prophet**.

🗓️The CPI has been calculated by using the base year of 2018, covering 90 cities which consists of 34 provincial capitals and 56 big cities all over Indonesia from 2020 until 2024 **(59 months)**.
